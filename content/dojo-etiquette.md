- When entering or leaving the dojo, it is proper to bow in the direction of O Sensei’s picture, the kamiza, or the front of the dojo. You should also bow when entering or leaving the mat.

- No shoes on the mat.

- Be on time for class. If you do happen to arrive late, sit quietly in seiza on the edge of the mat until the instructor grants permission to join practice.

- If you should have to leave the mat or dojo for any reason during class, approach the instructor and ask permission.

- Avoid sitting on the mat with your back to the picture of O Sensei or the kamiza. Also, do not lean against the walls or sit with your legs stretched out. (Either sit in seiza or cross-legged.)

- Remove watches, rings and other jewelry before practice.

- Do not bring food, gum, or beverages with you into the dojo.

- Please keep your finger and toe nails cut short.

- Please keep talking during class to a minimum. What conversation there is should be restricted to one topic – Aikido.

- Carry out the directives of the instructor PROMPTLY. Do not keep the rest of the class waiting for you!

- Do not engage in rough-housing or needless contests of strength during class.

- Keep your training uniform clean, in good shape, and free of offensive odors.

- Please pay your membership dues promptly. If, for any reason, you are unable to pay your dues on time, talk with the person in charge of dues collection.

- Sometimes special rates are available for those experiencing financial hardship – please ask.

- Do not change your clothes on the mat.

- Remember that you are here to learn, and not to gratify your ego. An attitude of receptivity and humility (though not obsequiousness) is therefore advised.

- Preserve common-sense standards of decency and respect at all times.
